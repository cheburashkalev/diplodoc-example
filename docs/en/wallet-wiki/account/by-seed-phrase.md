### Secret Wallet

Your wallet is already ready for use, but before using one small question. Would you like to use this wallet as a Secret Wallet? The secret wallet cannot be activated using One Pass, cannot be detected in the list of OnePass wallets. Such a wallet can be activated using the login and password set earlier.
