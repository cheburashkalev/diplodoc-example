## Token

A token is a digital representation of stored value that enables you to exchange value. Tokens represent assets of all types. They are typically stored and exchanged for other tokens that represent other types of assets. Tokens are minted, issued, transferred, or burned.

## System token or digital Coin

A digital coin, or coin, is a special token of a blockchain. It is special because it is used to pay for the system resources of that blockchain and it is also named system token. A blockchain can have one system token, that is, one digital coin. There are very rare occasions when a blockchain has more than one system token.

## Fungible Tokens

Fungible tokens are a huge class of the most common tokens on the blockchain. These include the most famous tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Binance coin (BNB) and many others. Simply put, if John has 1 BTC, Michael has 1 BTC and they exchange their tokens, then nothing will change, they will still have 1 BTC.

Fungible tokens can serve as a means of payment, as a medium of exchange, be used as a means of paying commissions, participate in the operation of decentralized applications, and much more.
It is very simple to create a fungible token on the GlobalForce platform; you can use a contract template, changing only the token parameters in it - the name of the token, its ticker, the emission size and the maximum emission size. But if you need additional features for the token, such as staking, freezing, distributed emission..., you will need some C++ programming knowledge.

## Create a new token

To create a new token, create the smart contract that manages that token. A token can take many forms and have various features.

Select of the following techniques to create a smart contract that manages a token:

Develop the smart contract from scratch
Use the existing sample smart contract as is ```new.token```
Use the existing sample smart contract and customize it to meet your requirements ```new.token```
