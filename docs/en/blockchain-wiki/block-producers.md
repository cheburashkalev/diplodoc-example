# Block producers

## GlobalForce nodes

GlobalForce nodes are built on a ```nodeos``` daemon that scans and synchronizes blocks. Each node has the ability to produce blocks, but to do this, it is necessary to confirm the status of the block producer by staking 20 million GFL tokens on behalf of the same account from which the node operates. This stake protects the network from outside attacks, since without a stake, no one will stop an attacker from installing a large number of nodes and taking over the network.

After staking, the node gains the right to produce and confirm blocks. For each block produced, the producer receives a reward, at the start of the network it was 19.319372 GFL, but the reward decreases by 1% monthly until the end of the issue, which will end in 2043.

Over 20 years of operation of the blockchain, 10 billion GFL tokens will be issued. Upon completion of the token emission, rewards to block producers will be made from funds spent by users on purchasing network resources.

Currently, GFL tokens spent by users on the acquisition of resources are distributed between the development fund (30%), the community through the gf.hold smart contract (30%), and 40% are burned, reducing the emission of the token.

Block Producers are responsible for creating blocks of tokens of the network and for the technical and administrative supervision of the GlobalForce.

Block Producers have the right to:

- Receive rewards for blocks produced.
- Participate in voting to cancel certain transactions (legal measures, suspected fraud, etc.)
- Participate in votes to change the system's smart contracts (basic rules for operating the network).
